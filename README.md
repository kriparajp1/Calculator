# calculator
Description: This repository contains a calculator project that I created two years ago using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator is a simple yet functional tool designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It serves as a practical demonstration of my frontend development skills and showcases my proficiency with these web technologies.
